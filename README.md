# Blasius-Boundary-Layer
It is a  CFD project of determining the (steady and Laminar) Boundary Layer Thickness using COMSOL MULTIPHYSICS simulation Software which solves the Navier Strokes Partial Differential Equation and gives
us the results like Velocity and Contour Profile, Pressure Profile, etc.

The incompressible boundary layer on a flat plate in the absence of a pressure gradient is usually referred to as the Blasius boundary layer. The steady, laminar boundary layer developing downstream of the 
leading edge eventually becomes unstable to Tollmienâ€“Schlichting waves and finally transitions to a fully turbulent boundary layer. Due to its fundamental importance, this type of flow has become 
the subject of numerous studies on boundary-layer flow, stability, transition, and turbulence. This application considers the first section of the plate where the boundary layer remains steady and
laminar and compares results from incompressible, two-dimensional, single-phase-flow simulations obtained in COMSOL Multiphysics to the Blasius similarity solution. The solutions converge ideally 
with respect to both mesh refinement and discretization order.
